          <p> I consider myself a "classically minded" and conservative developer. By "that, I mean a sensibility that promotes function over form.  Visually, I rely on styles that I know work because I have <i>seen </i> them work. But I am most interested in the functionality and the content of the web page.  I have always believed that those should do the proverbial "talking".</p>

          <p> Interested in both front-end <i>and</i> back-end development, I thoroughly enjoy connecting the pieces together in a manner that creates a beautiful whole. Informed by my liberal arts background, I am interested in just about any subject -- and shall prove one of the most interested laymen that you will ever work with.</p>

          <p> I was previously a writer and researcher in various forums; my writing has been published in Buzzfeed and the <i>New York Times</i>, among other places.  And I still write from time to time.  I am also an avid photographer, shooting with digital and film cameras. (Indeed, the cover photo is one of my recent 35mm stills!)

          <p>I recently completed a Web Development Intensive course at the New York Code and Design Academy, and I hold a B.A. in Government and Writing from Wesleyan University.</p>
