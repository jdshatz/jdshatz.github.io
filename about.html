          <p> I consider myself a "classically minded" and conservative developer. By "that, I mean a sensibility that promotes function over form.  Visually, I rely on styles that I know work because I have <i>seen </i> them work. But I am most interested in the functionality and the content of the web page.  I have always believed that those should do the proverbial "talking".</p>

          <p> And as interested as I may be in developing web experiences that attract and inform users, I am even <i>more</i> intrigued by the back-end side of web development. My favorite experience is connecting pieces together in a manner that creates a beautiful whole. Informed by my liberal arts background, I am interested in just about any subject -- and shall prove one of the most interested laymen that you will ever work with.</p>

          <p> I was previously a writer and researcher in various forums, and I still write from time to time.  As of now, I am preoccupied with honing my coding skills and bringing ideas to life. I recently completed a Web Development Intensive course at the New York Code and Design Academy, and I hold a B.A. in Government and Writing from Wesleyan University.</p>
